## Contact Tracing Project Overview

The IDENTOS contact tracing project provides base components required to allow for a Bluetooth-enabled tracing strategy that health organizations and citizens can use to anonymously record encounters with other users of the app, thus enabling both improved contact tracing, consent and user privacy. 

### What's in this Repository

- Android and iOS applications. These applications deliver the end-user experience and Bluetooth data exchange between devices.
- API service. Handles the current user on-boarding implementation, and can be expanded to support the 'Infected' submission and 'At Risk' notification.

### User Story 
The current implementation is based on Singapore's TraceTogether application.  

- User registers and confirms their mobile phone number
- User opens the application to privately and anonymously start broadcasting and receiving encounters from other app users (using Bluetooth to facilitate the exchange of encrypted encounter packages, which are stored on devices for 14 days)
- User privately stores results for their COVID screening and lab test (positive/negative/untested)
- User can consent to share their encounter history with health authorities if they test positive (utilizing cryptography and Bluetooth data exchange strategy)
- At-risk app users who have been exposed are notified in real-time, without presenting other usersâ€™ personally identifiable information

NOTE on privacy, cryptography and Bluetooth data exchange strategy: the current implementation exchanges a fixed identifier for testing purposes

### Possible Future Work

- Submission of an 'Infected' status - TBD
- Notification of an 'At Risk' state - TBD
